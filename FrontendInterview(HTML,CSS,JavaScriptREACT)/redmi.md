2-relative: The element is positioned relative to its normal position. Setting top, right, bottom, or left will cause it to be offset from its original position.
Example:
.relative-element {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}
3-absolute: The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with position set to relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky). If there is no such ancestor, it uses the initial containing block (typically the viewport).

Example:
css
Copy code



.absolute-element {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  right: 100px;
}
fixed: The element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.

Example:

Copy code



.fixed-element {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}
sticky: The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It toggles between relative and fixed depending on the scroll position.

Example:
css

.sticky-element {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0; /* will stick to the top when you reach its scroll position */
